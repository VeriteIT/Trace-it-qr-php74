/*
 * Notes, so nobody has to guess later:
 *
 * - Call it on EVERY publish, re-publishes included. It is idempotent, and only
 *   the first call for a given post ID creates anything or costs quota.
 *
 * - It never throws. If Trace-It is unreachable it returns null and logs through
 *   trigger_error. A QR code is not worth failing an editor's publish over; the
 *   code gets created on the next publish or on first page view instead.
 *
 * - The URL must be https. Trace-It rejects http, and this package drops the field
 *   rather than failing the call — so you would still get a working code, just
 *   without the "Original Source" button on its landing page.
 *
 * - The third argument is the ARTICLE's publication date, not the code's. Trace-It
 *   shows it as "Date Published" on the verification page; omit it and that falls
 *   back to when the code was created, which is only the same thing if you publish
 *   live. Backfilling an archive without it would claim every old story was
 *   published on the day you imported it. An unreadable date is rejected with
 *   400 invalid_published_at rather than silently replaced.
 *
 * - The IMAGE url is an optional fourth argument, and most integrations should
 *   leave it out. Snippet 3 looks the photo up from your own data instead, which
 *   is a local query in an endpoint that already has the post ID — and which
 *   cannot go stale the way a remembered URL does when an editor replaces a
 *   photo without re-publishing.
 *
 *   Pass it only if your composite endpoint cannot reach your CMS — a separate
 *   host, a static deployment — in which case it is the only thing framedImage()
 *   has to work from:
 *
 *       $traceIt->publish($postId, $url, $publishedAt, $draft->thumbUrl);
 *
 *   Either way it is never sent to Trace-It: we neither receive nor store your
 *   image URLs. It is written to your local cache and nowhere else.
