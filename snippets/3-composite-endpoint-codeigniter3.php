/**
 * SNIPPET 3, CODEIGNITER 3 VARIANT — serve the composited image from your domain.
 * ===========================================================================
 * Use this INSTEAD OF 3-composite-endpoint.php when your site runs CodeIgniter 3.
 * Everything in that file's header still applies — why compositing is the only
 * thing that satisfies "Save image as…", why it runs on your server, and why
 * ext-gd is required. This file changes one thing: how the response is sent.
 *
 * WHY IT MUST NOT CALL send(). FramedImage::send() writes headers with header()
 * and echoes the body itself. CodeIgniter holds the whole response and sends it
 * at the end of the request, so echoing past it puts the image ahead of the
 * framework's own output, and the headers you set by hand are then overwritten
 * or sent twice. The symptom is a broken image served as text/html — which reads
 * like a compositing failure and is not one. Hand the bytes to CodeIgniter.
 *
 * WHERE THIS HAS TO LIVE: on the site the public can reach. The page script sets
 * img.src to this URL, and Facebook, X and WhatsApp fetch it directly when they
 * build a share preview. An admin-only or IP-restricted CMS therefore cannot
 * host it — every reader and every crawler would be refused, and thumbnails
 * would quietly stay uncoded with nothing appearing broken.
 *
 * INSTALL
 *   1. application/controllers/Qr_image.php   <- this file
 *   2. application/config/routes.php:
 *        $route['traceit/v1/framed/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)\.jpg'] = 'qr_image/framed/$1';
 *   3. application/config/config.php:
 *        $config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;
 *      (or require your vendor/autoload.php yourself, before CI boots)
 *   4. point the page script at this origin:
 *        data-service="https://www.example.lk/traceit"
 *
 * There is deliberately no declare(strict_types=1) here. CodeIgniter 3 hands the
 * controller its own loosely typed values — route captures and query parameters
 * are always strings, models return what they return — and strict mode turns
 * ordinary framework behaviour into TypeErrors.
 * ===========================================================================
