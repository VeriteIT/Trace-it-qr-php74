 * Two behaviours matter more than the storage medium, and both are about money:
 *
 *   1. A create charges monthly quota, so a cache hit must not call Trace-It.
 *   2. When an article goes live and 500 readers arrive in the same second, that
 *      must be ONE create, not 500. Implementations do this in lock(), which is
 *      why the interface has a locking method at all rather than plain get/set.
 *
 * FilesystemStore is the default and needs nothing. Swap in Redis or your CMS's
 * own cache by implementing this — nothing else in the package changes.
