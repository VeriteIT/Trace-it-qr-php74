/**
 * Where this package's diagnostics go.
 * ===========================================================================
 * Everything here is a NON-FATAL degradation: something was dropped, skipped or
 * retried, the caller got a usable result, and nobody was going to see an
 * exception. That is the right behaviour — a QR code is never worth failing an
 * editor's publish or breaking an article page over — but it means these
 * messages are the ONLY evidence that a feature quietly stopped working.
 *
 * The default sink is trigger_error, which is the correct dependency-free
 * choice: it respects error_reporting, and log_errors routes it to whatever the
 * host already collects. But on a typical production php.ini display_errors is
 * Off, so nothing reaches a human unless somebody reads the PHP error log —
 * which, on a busy news site, nobody does.
 *
 * So pass `logger` and these become yours:
 *
 *     new TraceIt(['logger' => [$psr3Logger, 'log']]);
 *
 * The signature is deliberately PSR-3's: (string $level, string $message), with
 * $level one of 'warning' or 'notice'. A PSR-3 LoggerInterface::log() can
 * therefore be handed over directly, with no adapter to write. A closure works
 * just as well:
 *
 *     'logger' => fn (string $level, string $message) => Sentry::captureMessage($message)
 *
 * Messages are prefixed 'trace-it: ' before they are handed over, so they stay
 * greppable in a shared log.
